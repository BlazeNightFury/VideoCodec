# VideoCodec
This repository contains two frames of a video.
And the python code labelled VideoCodec.py performs the one of basic operations of a video compressor i.e. Estimating the consecutive frame from the current frame.
The python code labbelled ImageCodec.py performs a jpeg image compression and decompression on an image named "aerial.tiff" (grayscale)
The image codec can be integrated with the video codec to get a functional video compressor.

Note: Required python tools and libraries must be installed for the programs to run
Run the image codec with "Huffman.py" in the same folder
